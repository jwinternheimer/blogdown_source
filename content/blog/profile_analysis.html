title: "How many profiles do Free users use?"

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is a big focus on simplifying the product for Buffer users on free plans in 2017 in order to create a more intuitive experience and encourage more upgrades.</p>
<p>The purpose of this analysis is to get a better understanding of how users currently interact with the free plan, in order to better inform decisions around future plan limits. Specifically, we would love to learn about how many profiles users connect and actually schedule updates for.</p>
<p>More data questions and context can be found in <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Free-Plan-data-KJNJLDW3KtfMdZK4Z6DRS"><strong>this Paper</strong></a>, and potential changes to the Free plan can be found in <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Free-plan-changes-DVheYkvNs3yiE9Nhb9XRF"><strong>this Paper</strong></a>.</p>

<div id="methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>To answer this question, we’d like to only consider users that are currently <em>active</em>, and analyze their usage <em>during the period in which they were active in Buffer</em>. In this case, <em>active</em> is defined as having scheduled at least one update with Buffer in the previous 28 days.</p>
<p>We’ll gather all of the currently active users that are on free plans. Then, we will gather data on the number of profiles they have connected and the number of updates that they have scheduled <em>for each profile</em>.</p>
<p>Once we have this data, we will gather some summary statistics on the number of active profiles for each active user, and visualize the distribution of the number of profiles in use. It is unlikely to be normally distributed (bell shaped), so visualizing this breakdown would be useful to understanding the potential impact that changing the limits might have.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-collection" class="section level2">
<h2>Data collection</h2>
<p>Let’s start by getting the Free users that have scheduled at least one update in the past 28 days. We’ll use the following SQL query to grab them.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>with user_facts as (
  select
    up.user_id
    , max(up.created_at) as last_update_created_at
  from transformed_updates as up
  inner join users
    on users.user_id = up.user_id
  where up.status != &#39;service&#39;
  and users.billing_plan = &#39;individual&#39;
  group by up.user_id
)
select
  user_id
  , last_update_created_at
from user_facts
where last_update_created_at &gt; (current_date - 29)</code></pre>
<p>There are around 250 thousand users in this dataset! Now we need to get the number of updates they have scheduled, and the number of profiles that they have scheduled updates for.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>select
  up.user_id
  , count(distinct up.id) as updates_count
  , count(distinct up.profile_id) as profile_count
from transformed_updates as up
left join users
  on up.user_id = users.user_id
where users.billing_plan = &#39;individual&#39;
and up.status != &#39;service&#39;
and up.created_at &gt; (current_date - 29)
group by up.user_id</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! Now let’s join the <code>updates</code> and <code>users</code> dataframes so that we’ll have the number of updates and active profiles for each user. We’ll use <code>dplyr</code>’s <code>left_join</code> function and replace <code>NA</code> values with 0.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Join updates and users
users &lt;- users %&gt;%
  left_join(updates, by = &#39;user_id&#39;)

# Replace NAs with 0s
users[is.na(users)] &lt;- 0</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory analysis</h2>
<p>Now that we have the updates and profile counts for each active user, we can compute some quick summary statistics for our population.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get summary stats on the number of profiles
summary(users$profile_count)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   1.000   1.000   1.000   1.877   2.000 194.000</code></pre>
<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 50% of active Free plan users scheduled updates for only 1 profile in the past 28 days.</li>
<li>The average number of profiles that active Free plan users used in the past 28 days is around 1.9.</li>
<li>Around 75% of active Free plan users scheduled updates for only 2 or less profiles.</li>
<li>Someone scheduled updates for 194 profiles in the past 28 days!</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum of 194 brings up a good point about our sample: these are only users that are <em>currently</em> on individual plans. This means that they could have been on a paid plan in the past 28 days. I don’t think it’s a huge portion, or very significant for this particular analysis, but it is something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the distribution of profiles for active free users.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/profile_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Wow, that’s interesting! It looks like most currently active Free users have only scheduled updates to one profile in the past 28 days.</p>
<p>One possibility is that there are very new users that have only gotten the chance to schedule updates to one or two profiles. Let’s see what would happen if we only looked at users that have sent at least 5 updates in the past 28 days.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/profile_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see here that the proportion of active users that only schedule to a single profile changes quite a bit, but it is still high at 46.5%.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the CDF of the profiles distribution.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/profile_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Interesting! This graph tells us the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 56% of users scheduled updates to 1 profile in the past 28 days.</li>
<li>Around 76% of users scheduled updates to 2 or less profiles in the past 28 days.</li>
<li>Around 91% of users scheduled updates to 3 or less profiles in the past 28 days.</li>
<li>Around 98% of users scheduled updates to 4 or less profiles in the past 28 days.</li>
</ul>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>If we were to go with the “less limited” Free plan and only allow users to connect up to 3 profiles, the data suggests that somewhere around 10% of currently active users would be affected. This equates to around 25k users.</p>
<p>If we were to go with the “more limited” Free plan and only allow 2 profiles, the data suggests that somewhere around 25% of currently active users would be affected! This equates to around 63k users.</p>
<p>I think it’s important to note that this is just a snapshot of <em>currently</em> active users that are <em>currently</em> on Individual plans.</p>
<p>There are still important things that we <strong>don’t</strong> know as of yet. We don’t know how these users with 3 or more profiles will repond if we change the limits, even if they don’t actively use all of their profiles. We can assume that a certain amount will updgrade, but a certain amount will also leave Buffer. We also don’t quite know what effect word-of-mouth will have. We also may make the assumption that people with only 1 or 2 profiles will be unaffected – this may not necessarily be the case. We don’t fully understand the underlying causal effects that the profile limits have.</p>
<p>One way to get a better understanding of those causal mechanisms would be to run an experiment. If we could adjust the profile limits of a subset of our active Free user population, and allow them to upgrade to increase their limits, we would be able to make a better estimate of how this change might affect our user base and revenue stream. I would suggest running an experiment on a small subset of our active Free user population before making any definitive statement on the effect it will have on revenue.</p>
